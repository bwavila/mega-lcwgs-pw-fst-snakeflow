mega-lcwgs-pw-fst-snakeflow
================

This is a simple Snakemake workflow for calculating pairwise Fsts (and
related quantities, eventually, I suppose) from BAM files using ANGSD.

Note that the `mega` in the name doesn’t refer to anything that I think
is “millions-esque” about this project. It is simply one of the
workflows we use in the **M**olecular **E**cology and **G**enetic
**A**nalysis (MEGA) Team at the NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science,
Fisheries Ecology Division.
